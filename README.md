# TitanicSurvivalPrediction
Use KNN, GaussianNB, SVM algorithm to predict survived of titanic.

## Installation
Combine the train data and test data of the Titanic, and use the knn algorithm to predict the missing age.
The train data is divided into 70% training set and 30% prediction set to predict the survival rate of Titanic, and the accuracy of the model is predicted through knn, SVM, and GaussianNB algorithms.

## Library
